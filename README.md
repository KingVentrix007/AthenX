# AthenX
My cool OS

Just a simple 32bit OS that I am using to learn assembly coding and c
# Features:
-Currently no available commands except dump witch prints out the register values and test which calls the panic function
-It has a simple string library
-It has a basic VGA graphic driver and a VGA text driver that is currently broken
- It has a basic keyboard driver
- It has a completely unreliable delay system
- it has a ridiculously over complicated time system
- it has a very basic debug function that writes everything to COM1

# Future plans
-MORE COMMANDS
- basic text editor
- more advanced keyboard
- speaker driver
- sata,ide,hdd,USB driver
- custom file format
- FAT12 support

- basic chat application
- c libraries
- powers systems(shutdown, reboot, sleep)
- multitasking(maybe)
