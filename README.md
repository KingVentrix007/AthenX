My cool OS

Just a simple 32bit OS that I am using to learn assembly coding and c
# Features:
- It has a simple string library
- It has a basic VGA graphic driver and a VGA text driver that is currently broken
- It has a basic keyboard driver
- It has a completely unreliable delay system

- it has a very basic debug function that writes everything to COM1

# Future plans
